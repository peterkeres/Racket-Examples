Undergraduate Assignment

    Find two prime numbers p and q with at least four digits each and send me a public key (N,e), and I will send you a coded message x ^ e MOD N. You get to choose N and e.
    I will send you an encoded message using your public key.
    Send me the decoded message back in an email.
    The message I send will be an integer less than N.

Extra Credit

    Compute two prime numbers, p and q, with 100 or more digits using Scheme.
    Send me a public key (N,e) based on p and q. Choose a suitable e.
    Send me any Scheme code you create for selecting primes.
