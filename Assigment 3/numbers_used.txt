MY TWO PRIME NUMBERS:

p= 4007
q= 8807


MY NUMBERS SENT TO HIM TO ENCRYPT

N = p*q
N = 35,289,649
  to pick next number, we have to find a number that is relatively prime to
  (p-1) and (q-1).
  in other words, a number that doesn't share any common factors between the 2
  this will be E

(4007 - 1) 4006
(8807 - 1) 8806


(p-1) * (q-1) = 35276836

E = 3
  3 does not have any common factors with any of the 2 numbers above
  most people pick 3 because its computes fast and normally works.

  with E and N, he can encrypt a message aka my public key

MY PRIVATE KEY USED TO DECYRPT

D = private KEY
D = the inverse of E


//new part of decrypt
// I messed up, use the site

(p-1) * (q-1) = 35276836
 use this to find the D
https://www.cryptool.org/en/cto-highlights/rsa-step-by-step
use this to find the new D
D = 23517891



  in order to find D, we use his 'extended-euclid' method he provides us

  we send extended-euclid 2 numbers, E and (p-1) aka (3, 4006)

  of the numbers sent back, we take the first one (-1335) and add to it (p-1) aka 4006

  which gives us 2,671

D = 2,671


the message i got back was

6617277

Now we take this and try to decode it, we use the following math formula
(message) ^ D mod N
6617277 ^ 2671 mod 35289649

//new numbers after my mess up
6617277 ^ 23517891 mod 35289649

I used a simple webside to run this calculations

the answer too this problem is the uncoded message
which is : 9585924

//real messaged
654321
